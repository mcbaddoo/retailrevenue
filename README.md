   - An extension of Adidas products sold at full prices may maximize revenue, as these products generate the most total revenue,        regardless of price and despite being heavily discounted.

   - Incentivizing an increase in a product’s customer reviews and sustaining the amount incoming throughout the year may lead to a      rise in a product’s revenue, as a strong positive correlation between a product’s revenue and reviews was determined, in spite      of most reviews being made in Q1.
